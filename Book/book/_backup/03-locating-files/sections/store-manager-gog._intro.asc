GOG Galaxy functions as the dedicated store manager for all games available on GOG. The GOG Store Manager strategically locates the 'galaxy-2.0.db' file within the store managers' directory. Employing Sqlite3, the file undergoes decoding through a specialized 'SELECT productId, installationPath FROM InstalledBaseProducts' query, revealing crucial information about the installation locations of the games.
