**Chapter 4: File Manager**

A File Manager plays a vital role in helping locate game folders by examining specific directories, store managers, or the Windows registry. The file manager provides crucial functionalities such as 'ApplicationByDirectory', 'ApplicationByStore', and 'ApplicationByRegistry' for efficient navigation and retrieval of game assets.

- **ApplicationByDirectory:** This functionality enables the search for the game within specified folder(s) located in the /Games directory, streamlining the process of locating game files.

- **ApplicationByStore:** By leveraging the ApplicationByStore feature, users can search for games within designated store manager(s), including popular options like the Blizzard Store Manager, Epic Store Manager, Gog Store Manager, and Steam Store Manager.

- **ApplicationByRegistry:** The ApplicationByRegistry feature allows for searching for games using specified registry key(s) within the Windows Registry across various locations such as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, KEY_CURRENT_USER, and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, amongst others. Following the identification of a registry key, the File Manager attempts to locate a directory by scanning key values like Path, Install Dir, or InstallLocation.

Moreover, in scenarios where games are stored in sub-folders within the root game folder, paths specified by the game can be combined with the initially identified root folder to streamline the path resolution process and optimize file location procedures. Leveraging the functionalities of the File Manager enables digital creators to efficiently access and manage game assets, enhancing productivity and organizational capabilities within the game development environment.
