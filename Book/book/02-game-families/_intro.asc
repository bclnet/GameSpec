**Chapter 1: Game Families**

*Game Families*

Games and their settings are often grouped into families within the video game industry. Development studios frequently reuse technologies or formats developed for previous games, leading to common settings and small iterations between games. By categorizing games into families, the decoding of file formats for these games is simplified. This approach streamlines the management and utilization of game assets, enabling digital creators to build upon existing frameworks and enhance the overall gaming experience. Understanding the concept of Game Families is crucial for effective asset organization and utilization in game development projects.
