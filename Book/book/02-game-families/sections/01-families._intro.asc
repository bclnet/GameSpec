**Game Families**

In the dynamic landscape of the video game industry, games and their settings are structured into families, emphasizing related Editions, DLCs, and Locales. Development studios often adopt a practice of reusing technologies and formats developed for previous games. By grouping games into families, studios can implement small iterations between games, leading to streamlined file format decoding. This systematic approach enables creators to build upon existing frameworks and enhance gaming experiences efficiently. Understanding the concept of Game Families plays a pivotal role in simplifying asset management and utilization in game development endeavors.
