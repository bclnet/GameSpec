**Game Families**

Games and their settings are commonly organized into families within the video game industry, encompassing related Editions, DLCs, and Locales. Development studios often adopt a practice of reusing technologies and formats developed for earlier games within the same family. By categorizing games into families, studios can introduce incremental changes and common settings, which simplifies the process of decoding file formats for these related games. This approach enables digital creators to efficiently navigate and understand the nuances of each game family, facilitating a streamlined workflow when working with game assets. Familiarity with the concept of Game Families empowers creators to leverage existing resources and build upon established foundations, fostering innovation and creativity within the dynamic landscape of game development.
