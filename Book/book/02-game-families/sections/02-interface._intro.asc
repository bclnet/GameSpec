**Interface**

In the context of working with game assets, the Family object serves as the primary entry point for accessing any game asset within a specific game family. To retrieve a specific Family, one can make a request to the FamilyManager, which manages and provides access to all defined game families. Once the Family object is obtained, it enables access to a PakFile by utilizing a Resource definition or URI.

Upon initializing a PakFile object, various methods become available for interacting with individual resources within the game assets. Some of the key methods provided by the PakFile object include:

- **Open:** This method enables the opening of the PakFile for further processing and access to its contents.
- **Contains:** Used to determine if a specific resource or file is contained within the PakFile.
- **LoadFileDataAsync:** Asynchronously loads the file data associated with a particular resource within the PakFile.
- **LoadFileObjectAsync:** Asynchronously loads the file object related to a specific resource, allowing for further manipulation and utilization of the asset.

By leveraging these methods within the PakFile object, digital creators can effectively navigate and interact with individual resources within game assets, paving the way for seamless integration and utilization of game assets within their projects.
