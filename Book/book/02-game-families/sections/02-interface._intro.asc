**Interface**

The Family object serves as the primary entry point for accessing any game asset within the system. To initiate access to a specific Family, one can make a request to the FamilyManager, which manages the Family instances. From the Family object, a PakFile can be opened using a designated Resource definition or URI.

Upon successfully accessing a PakFile, the PakFile object provides access to individual resources within the file. This access is facilitated through a set of methods tailored for resource management and retrieval, including Open, Contains, LoadFileDataAsync, and LoadFileObjectAsync. These methods empower creators to efficiently interact with and manipulate game assets at a granular level, ensuring seamless integration and utilization within the game development process.
