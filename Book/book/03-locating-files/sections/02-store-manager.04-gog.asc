GOG Galaxy serves as the designated store manager for all GOG games. The GOG Store Manager identifies the 'galaxy-2.0.db' file within the store manager's directory. This file is decoded using Sqlite3, and the query 'SELECT productId, installationPath FROM InstalledBaseProducts' contains the location of the installed games.
