Steam serves as the dedicated store manager for all games within its ecosystem. The Steam Store Manager locates the 'libraryfolders.vdf' file in the managers' directory. Employing the 'AcfStruct' encoding, this file is decoded, revealing the 'path' field, which points to other 'appmanifest_{appId}.acf' files. Subsequently, these files undergo further decoding with the 'AcfStruct' encoding, exposing the 'AppState.installdir' field that specifies the location of the installed games.
