The File Manager serves as a centralized repository for file information, encompassing details such as Paths, Ignores, and Filters to streamline asset management processes.

When locating Paths within game folders, the system scans specific directories, existing store managers, or the Windows registry to retrieve relevant information. The following methods are employed:

- *getPathByDirectory*: Searches for the game in the specified folder(s) located within the /Games folder.
- *getPathByStoreKey*: Identifies the game in specified store manager(s) such as Blizzard, Epic, Gog, and Steam.
- *getPathByRegistry Key*: Searches for the game using the specified registry key(s) in the Windows Registry under locations including HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE, KEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE, and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/VirtualStore/MACHINE/SOFTWARE. Once a registry key is located, the system searches for directory information within values such as Path, Install Dir, InstallDir, InstallLocation, Installed Path, ExePath, and Exe.

For games that initiate in a sub-folder of the root game folder, additional paths can be specified and combined with the initially located root folder to ensure comprehensive access and management of game assets.
