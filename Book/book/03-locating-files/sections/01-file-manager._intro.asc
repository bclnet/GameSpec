The File Manager serves as a centralized repository for essential file information, encompassing details such as Paths, Ignores, and Filters crucial for efficiently managing game assets. Paths play a key role in locating game folders through specific directories, existing store managers, or the Windows registry. The File Manager provides various methods for retrieving paths, including:

- **getPathByDirectory:** Searches for the game in the specified folder(s) located in the /Games directory.
  
- **getPathByStoreKey:** Locates the game through store managers such as the Blizzard Store Manager, Epic Store Manager, Gog Store Manager, and Steam Store Manager.

- **getPathByRegistryKey:** Searches for the game using specified registry key(s) in the Windows Registry across key locations like HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE, KEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE, and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/VirtualStore/MACHINE/SOFTWARE. Once a registry key is identified, the File Manager attempts to locate a directory by scanning key values like Path, Install Dir, InstallDir, InstallLocation, or fetching the directory location from values like Installed Path, ExePath, Exe.

Furthermore, in scenarios where games are stored in sub-folders of the root game folder, additional paths specified by the game are combined with the initially discovered root folder to enhance path resolution and streamline file location processes.
