Steam functions as the store manager for all Steam games.
The Steam Store Manager pinpoints the 'libraryfolders.vdf' file situated in the managers directory.
Decoding the file through the 'AcfStruct' encoding reveals the 'path' field, which leads to the other 'appmanifest_{appId}.acf' files.
Subsequently, these files undergo decoding using the 'AcfStruct' encoding, with the 'AppState.installdir' field indicating the location of the installed games.
