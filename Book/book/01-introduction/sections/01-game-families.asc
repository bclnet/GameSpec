**Game Families**

In the world of game development, games and their settings are often grouped into families. This categorization is driven by the tendency of development studios to reuse technologies or formats developed for previous games. By grouping games into families, development studios can leverage common settings and make small iterations between games, simplifying the process of file format decoding for these games. This approach streamlines the management and utilization of game assets, enabling creators to build upon existing frameworks and enhance the overall gaming experience.
