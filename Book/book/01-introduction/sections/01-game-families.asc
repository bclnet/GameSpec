**Game Families**

Games and their settings are often grouped into families within the video game industry. Development studios frequently leverage and reuse technologies or formats that have been developed for previous games within the same family. By categorizing games into families, common settings and incremental changes between games are implemented. This simplifies the process of decoding file formats for games within the same family, allowing for more efficient reuse of assets and consistent methodologies in handling game assets. Understanding the concept of game families can provide valuable insights into the underlying structures and relationships between different games within a studio's portfolio.
