Write the long introduction chapter of a technical book using the following headers and details:

Getting Started:
The video game industry produces game assets every year comprising of textures, models, animations, maps, sounds and other files to define the game assets and logic. Our purpose is to be able to repurpose these assets.

As a categorization games have been grouped into families usually following the game studio as games file formats evolve.

Platform providers and applications are provided to work with or browse game assets.

Game Families:
1. Games and their settings are grouped into families.
Development studios typically reuse technologies or formats developed for previous games. Grouping games by families allow common settings and small iterations between games to simply the file format decoding for these games.

Locating Files:
2. Locate the game files for any installed game.
A combination of Windows Registry entries, Game Store applications, or specific folders help to locate any installed games and file locations.

Decoding Archives:
3. Decode the game archives which contain the game assets.
Video games use proprietary file formats to create archive files which hold the many game asset files, decoding these formats for each game provides access to the individual game asset files. 

Decoding Assets:
4. Decode the game assets into a portable format.
The individual files that comprise the game assets use proprietary file formats, decoding these formats for each game provides access to the actual asset data.

Using Assets:
5. Using located game assets in modern game development platforms like Unity, Unreal Engine and OpenGL, using platform providers.
