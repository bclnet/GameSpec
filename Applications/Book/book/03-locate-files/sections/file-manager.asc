=== File Manager

A File Manager is an indispensable tool for locating game folders through targeted searches in specific directories, store managers, or the Windows Registry. The process is organized into three distinct methods:

- **ApplicationByDirectory:** This method conducts searches within game-specified folders, typically located in the /Games directory.

- **ApplicationByStore:** It broadens the search by delving into game-specified store managers, including the Blizzard Store Manager, Epic Store Manager, GOG Store Manager, and Steam Store Manager.

- **ApplicationByRegistry:** This method explores the Windows Registry, searching for the game using specified registry keys in locations such as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE, KEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/VirtualStore/MACHINE/SOFTWARE, and others. Upon finding a relevant registry key, an attempt is made to locate the game directory by inspecting specific registry key values or extracting directory information from associated files.

In addition to these methods, the process accounts for the complexity of game organization, acknowledging that some games may initiate in a sub-folder of the root game directory. Games have the flexibility to specify additional paths, which are then seamlessly combined with the initially identified root folder for a comprehensive game location approach.
