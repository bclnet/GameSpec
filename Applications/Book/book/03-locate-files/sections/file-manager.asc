=== File Manager

The File Manager serves as a centralized repository for essential file information, encompassing Paths, Ignores, and Filters. The process of locating Paths within game folders involves meticulous searches in specific directories, existing store managers, or the Windows Registry. To streamline this endeavor, three distinct methods are employed:

- **Get Path By Directory:** This method diligently explores game-specified folders, primarily situated in the /Games directory.

- **Get Path By Store Key:** Broadening the search horizon, this method delves into game-specified store managers, including the Blizzard Store Manager, Epic Store Manager, GOG Store Manager, and Steam Store Manager.

- **Get Path By Registry Key:** Venturing into the Windows Registry, this method navigates specified registry keys across locations such as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE, KEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE, and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/VirtualStore/MACHINE/SOFTWARE. Upon identifying a relevant registry key, the directory is sought through searches in registry key values like Path, Install Dir, InstallDir, InstallLocation, or by extracting directory information from associated files.

Acknowledging the nuanced organization of games, the process accommodates instances where certain games initiate in a sub-folder of the root game directory. Games retain the flexibility to specify additional paths, seamlessly amalgamating them with the initially identified root folder for a comprehensive approach to game directory location.
