An extended retry of unrealized plans for Freelancer, Star Citizen is being led by director Chris Roberts. The game was announced via a private crowdfunding page in September 2012, and was later joined on October 18, 2012 by a successful Kickstarter campaign which drew in over US$2 million.[3] Pre-production of the game began in 2010, with production starting in 2011.
